1. Introduction and Purpose:
   Describe the objective of the app.
   "CountryDetails is a React-based web application that provides comprehensive information about countries around the world. Users can search for countries, view detailed information such as population, area, region, currencies, and more. The app delivers a clean, modern, and responsive experience, making it easy for users to explore country data on any device."

2. Project Demo:
   Mention the live demo to showcase the project.
   "You can view a live demo of the application here: https://world-info12.netlify.app/"
3. Core Features:
   Highlight the key functionality of the app.
   "Some key features of the CountryDetails app include:
   Search Functionality: Users can search for any country by its name.
   Country Details Page: Each country has its own details page displaying information such as capital, population, area, region, currencies, languages, and more.
   Responsive Design: The app has a fully responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
   Navigation Menu: I implemented a mobile-friendly hamburger menu with smooth transitions to enhance the navigation experience."
4. Technologies Used:
   Explain the technologies and why you chose them.
   "I used the following technologies to build the app:
   React: To build the user interface components in a modular way.
   Tailwind CSS: For styling. Its utility-first approach allowed me to quickly build a responsive and modern design.
   React Router: To enable smooth client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between the search results and individual country detail pages without reloading the entire page.
   Axios: To handle API requests efficiently for fetching country data from an external API.
   React Icons: For integrating beautiful and customizable icons throughout the app."
5. API Integration:
   Explain how you integrated the API for data fetching.

"The app fetches country data from an external API, such as the RestCountries API. I used Axios to make asynchronous API requests, retrieve country details, and display them dynamically on the page. The API returns data such as country name, capital, population, area, currencies, languages, and region, which I parse and display using reusable React components."
